I developed this project while learning java. The app uses swing. The Math.random () method is used to randomly select a number. The user then has to guess the number. After the user has attempted to guess, he is in-formed whether the number guessed by him was bigger or smaller than the selected number. There are unlimited attempts. If the user is successful in guessing the number right, he gets the option of playing a new round. The player can quit at any stage of the game.
